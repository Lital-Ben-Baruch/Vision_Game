## Project Title: Vision Game

### Description
Vision Game is an innovative project that merges physical activity with the excitement of digital gaming. It allows users to interact with any computer game that utilizes mouse clicks for control. By projecting the game onto a wall, a simple ball is transformed into an interactive game controller. When the ball hits the wall, its impact is detected and translated into a virtual mouse click within the game on the computer. This approach not only introduces a new dimension to digital gaming but also encourages physical activity and enhances hand-eye coordination.

### Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

Vision Game is currently in its development phase. Our team is diligently working on refining the computer vision technology, improving the accuracy of ball detection, and ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Objectives
- To develop a Python-based program capable of processing live video feeds for precise ball detection.
- To convert physical interactions (ball impacts) into digital commands (mouse clicks) for any mouse-controlled game.
- To provide a unique and interactive way to play a wide variety of computer games.

### Hardware Requirements
- A computer with Python installed.
- A digital camera or webcam.
- A projector.

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for video capture and ball detection)
- PyAutoGUI (for simulating mouse clicks)
- NumPy (for handling numerical operations)

### Setup and Installation
*Detailed instructions for setting up the project, including software installations and hardware configurations, will be provided as the project progresses.*

### Usage
*Instructions on how to use the system will be added upon the project's completion.*
