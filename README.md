## Project Title: Vision Game

### Description
Vision Game is an innovative project that combines physical activity with digital gaming excitement. It enables users to interact with computer games that require mouse clicks by projecting the game onto a wall. A simple ball becomes an interactive game controller; its impact on the wall is detected and translated into a virtual mouse click in the game. This approach adds a new dimension to digital gaming, promoting physical activity and enhancing hand-eye coordination.

### Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

Vision Game is in the development phase. Our team is focused on refining the computer vision technology to improve ball detection accuracy and ensure a seamless, intuitive user experience.

### Objectives
- Develop a Python-based program for precise ball detection in live video feeds.
- Transform physical interactions (ball impacts) into digital commands (mouse clicks) for mouse-controlled games.
- Offer a unique, interactive way to play various computer games.

### Hardware Requirements
- A computer with Python installed.
- A digital camera or webcam.
- A projector.

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for video capture and ball detection)
- PyAutoGUI (for simulating mouse clicks)
- NumPy (for numerical operations)

### Setup and Installation
*Detailed setup instructions, including software installations and hardware configurations, will be provided as the project progresses.*

### Usage
*Usage instructions will be added upon project completion.*
