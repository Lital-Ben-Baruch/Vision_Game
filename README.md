## Project Title: Vision Game

### Description
Vision Game is an innovative project that blends physical activity with digital gaming. It enables users to interact with any computer game that uses mouse clicks for control. By projecting the game onto a wall, a simple ball is transformed into an interactive game controller. When the ball hits the wall, its impact is detected and translated into a virtual mouse click within the game on the computer. This approach not only adds a new dimension to digital gaming but also promotes physical activity and hand-eye coordination.

### Status
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** ðŸš§

Vision Game is currently in its development phase. Our team is focused on refining the computer vision technology, enhancing the accuracy of ball detection, and ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

### Objectives
- To develop a Python-based program capable of processing live video feeds for accurate ball detection.
- To convert physical interactions (ball impacts) into digital commands (mouse clicks) within any mouse-controlled game.
- To offer a unique and interactive method for playing a wide range of computer games.

### Hardware Requirements
- A computer with Python installed.
- A digital camera or webcam.
- A projector.

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (for video capture and ball detection)
- PyAutoGUI (for simulating mouse clicks)
- NumPy (for handling numerical operations)

### Setup and Installation
*Detailed instructions for setting up the project, including software installations and hardware configurations, will be provided as the project progresses.*

### Usage
*Guidelines on how to operate the system will be added upon the project's completion.*
